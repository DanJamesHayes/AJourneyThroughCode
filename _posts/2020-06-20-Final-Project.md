Here is the feasability study, report and code for the final project. A set of scripts that connect to the twitter API to scrape tweets containing links to news sites. Deep learning algorithms trained on the tweets that can then be used to infer certain implications from other tweets. Finally, a minimum viable product of a web app where tweet text can be submitted and ran through the trained algorithms.
