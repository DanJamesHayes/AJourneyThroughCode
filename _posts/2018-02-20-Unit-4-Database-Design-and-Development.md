This first report is a requirements analysis of a database system for a small window installation company. There is an entity relationship diagram based on the current file system followed by normalisation of that ERD.

[Report One](https://drive.proton.me/urls/MQSMPTYX7W#7hGgQqZv8AUy)

The second report redraws the entity relationship diagram based on the normalistaion documented in the first report.  The report then documents the testing of the built database.

[Report Two](https://drive.proton.me/urls/7DPQGSD178#0kxr3vKeI0pR)

This is the code for the database based on the design in the previous reports.
